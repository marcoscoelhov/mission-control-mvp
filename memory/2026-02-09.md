## CRM Reinado work (major)
- User asked to evaluate and implement CRM "Reinado" phases.
- Main project to centralize work: `/root/.openclaw/workspace/projects/crm-kanban`.
- Confirmed Tailscale access used by user: `http://100.73.57.32:5001`.

## Delivered work summary
- Phase 1 implemented in Reinado UI (theme, mission modal/button, initial integration).
- Phase 2 requested and progressed (Stark/Jarvis/Alfred/workers features were initiated via sub-agent and merged into project files).
- Phase 3 reported as implemented (budget cap, alerts, Jarvis insights, worker heartbeat SSE) with docs file `REINADO_FASE3.md`.
- Phase 4 reported as implemented (API `/api/v1` + JWT + mobile dashboard) with docs file `REINADO_FASE4.md`.

## Validation notes
- Initial confusion from user due to opening root path `/` (old CRM view) instead of `/reinado`.
- Correct Reinado path confirmed: `/reinado`.
- User screenshot later confirmed new Reinado page was opening.
- Fixed an API mismatch in `app.py` for `/api/v1/budget/consume` to match `record_budget_consumption(...)` signature.

## User communication preference observed
- User wants direct, practical validation and explicit deploy confirmation.
- User is sensitive to "looks same as old version"; visual proof/URL precision matters.

## Late-night diagnostics (Telegram)
- User asked to verify Telegram bot/channel because messages there were silent.
- Attempt to poll Telegram from this WhatsApp-bound session failed due to provider isolation (`Cross-context messaging denied`).
- Log review showed recurring WhatsApp reconnect noise (status 499/503), but no evidence of Telegram channel activity.
- Direct config check result: Telegram is not configured in this gateway (`telegram_config_present: false` in `/root/.openclaw/openclaw.json`), which explains silence.
- Next actionable step offered to user: configure Telegram via BotFather token + gateway config + restart.
